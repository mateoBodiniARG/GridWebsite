Responsive Website with CSS Grid
Welcome to my responsive website project! I created this website to practice my CSS Grid design skills. I used HTML and CSS to create the structure and styling of the site, and media queries to make sure the site looks and works perfectly on any device. I'm very pleased with the result and think it's a great example of what can be achieved with CSS Grid. Check out the website and let me know what you think!
